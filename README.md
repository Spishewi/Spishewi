# Hi, I'm Spishewi 👋

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Polytech Tours with a strong interest in **software engineering** and **DevOps**. I enjoy building things end-to-end: from algorithm design and architecture to deployment and automation.

Outside of coding and class, I stay up to date with tech through continuous learning, conferences, and hands-on projects.

## What I do

- 🧠 Software development in **Python**, **C/C++**, and **TypeScript/JavaScript (React, Bun)**.
- 🎮 Small games and interactive applications (game jams, personal and academics projects).
- 🖥️ Linux server administration and **containerization** (Docker-style workflows).
  - Manage my own server with containerized applications.
  - Manage game servers for my friends.
  - Build containers for my own applications and services.
- 🤖 Lead technical workshops for students and teenagers on differents topics.
  - On robotics and with **Arduino** and **Micro:bit** (MicroPython, C, block-based tools).
  - On development, with activities around Python, algorithms, and game development.

## Skills

- **Languages**: Python, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript.
- **Frameworks/libraries**: Pygame, React.
- **Systems / DevOps**: Linux server administration, container creation and deployment.
- **Robotics / Hardware**: Arduino, Micro:bit (block-based tools, MicroPython, C).
- **Languages (human)**: French (native), English **C1** (TOEIC practice test 945).

## What I'm aiming for

In the medium term, I want to grow into a **DevOps / platform engineering** role, where I can combine my interest in **infrastructure**, **automation**, and **developer experience** with my current knowledge in software engineering.

If any of my projects resonate with you or you’d like to discuss DevOps, game dev, or educational tech, feel free to reach out or open an issue/discussion on one of my repos.
